<h2>Advanced Usage</h2>

<h3>Private RSS Channels using HTTP Authentication</h3>
<p>In some cases a private RSS feed might be protected by HTTP authentication where you must enter a username and a password to access it. You can use BalloonRSS also for such feeds. For this you need to edit the channel configuration file <i>channelConfig.xml</i>. It is located in the user data directory, e.g. at <i>C:\Users\&lt;user_name&gt;\AppData\Roaming\BalloonRSS</i> for Windows Vista and <i>C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;user_name&gt;\Application Data\BalloonRSS</i> for WinXP. This directory may be hidden and you may have to type the link in the explorer window directly to access it. There, you need to add the XML tags <i>httpAuthUsername</i> and <i>httpAuthPassword</i> to the configuration. Here you see an example:</p>
<p><i>channelConfig.xml</i>:</p>
<pre>
&lt;channels&gt;
  &lt;item&gt;
    &lt;link&gt;http://link_to_private_RSS_channel/rss.xml&lt;/link&gt;
    &lt;priority&gt;5&lt;/priority&gt;
    &lt;httpAuthUsername&gt;enter_username_here&lt;/httpAuthUsername&gt;
    &lt;httpAuthPassword&gt;enter_password_here&lt;/httpAuthPassword&gt;
  &lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/channels&gt;
</pre>
<p>This configuration is not visible within the graphical channel settings dialog. I think that protected RSS channels are an exceptional use case and I do not want to confuse the average user with such settings, which are normally not needed.</p>


<h3>Configuration in Multi-User Environment</h3>

<h4>Pre-Definition of RSS Channel Settings</h4>
<p>BalloonRSS uses 2 channel configuration files:</p>
<ol>
<li>A user specific channel configuration (located in the user settings directory, e.g. C:\Users\&lt;user_name&gt;\AppData\Roaming\BalloonRSS)</li>
<li>A computer specific channel configuration (located in the program directory, e.g. C:\Program Files\BalloonRSS).</li>
</ol>

<p>Using the configuration dialogs in the GUI, you always modify user's channel entries. The global channel settings can only be changed by directly creating and editing the configuration .xml file.</p>

<p>The easiest way to configure the global channel settings is to configure the desired global channels as a user and then move the channelConfig.xml file from the user settings directory to the program directory. Afterwards you may add additional user channels.</p>

<h4>Pre-Definition of Application Settings</h4>
<p>You may pre-define application settings in a multi-user environment by putting a configuration file <i>BalloonRss.exe.config</i> in the program directory. You need to manually edit this XML file. You start by obtaining the default settings file from the <a href="https://github.com/embyt/balloonrss">GitHub project</a> at <a href="https://github.com/embyt/balloonrss/blob/master/bin/BalloonRss.exe.config">/bin/BalloonRss.exe.config</a> and modify it according your needs.</p>

<p>Once a user modifies its settings using the application configuration dialog, BalloonRSS will create a user specific setting file in the user directory. This file then overrides the global application settings.</p>
