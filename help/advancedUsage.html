<h2>Private RSS Channels using HTTP Authentication</h2>
<p>In some cases a private RSS feed might be protected by HTTP authentication where you must enter a username and a password to access it. You can use BalloonRSS also for such feeds. For this you need to edit the channel configuration file <i>channelConfig.xml</i>. It is located in the user data directory, e.g. at <i>C:\Users\xxx\AppData\Roaming\BalloonRSS</i> for Windows Vista and <i>C:\Documents and Settings\xxx\Application Data\BalloonRSS</i> for WinXP. You need to add the XML tags <i>httpAuthUsername</i> and <i>httpAuthPassword</i> to the configuration. Here you see an example:</p>
<p><i>channelConfig.xml</i>:</p>
<pre>
&lt;channels&gt;
  &lt;item&gt;
    &lt;link&gt;http://link_to_private_RSS_channel/rss.xml&lt;/link&gt;
    &lt;priority&gt;5&lt;/priority&gt;
    &lt;httpAuthUsername&gt;some_user&lt;/httpAuthUsername&gt;
    &lt;httpAuthPassword&gt;some_password&lt;/httpAuthPassword&gt;
  &lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/channels&gt;
</pre>
<p>This configuration is not visible within the graphical channel settings dialog. I think that protected RSS channels are an exceptional case and I do not want to confuse normal users with such settings, which are normally not needed.</p>


<h2>Configuration in Multi-User Environment</h2>

<h3>Pre-Definition of RSS Channel Settings</h3>
<p>BalloonRSS uses 2 channel configuration files:</p>
<ol>
<li>A user specific channel configuration (located in the user settings directory, e.g. C:\Users\xxx\AppData\Roaming\BalloonRSS)
<li>A computer specific channel configuration (located in the program directory, e.g. C:\Program Files\BalloonRSS).
</ol>

<p>Using the configuration dialogs in the GUI, you always modify user's channel entries. The global channel settings can only be changed by directly editing the configuration .xml file.</p>

<p>The easiest way to configure the global channel settings is to configure the desired global channels as a user and then move the channelConfig.xml file from the user settings directory to the program directory. Afterwards you may add additional user channels.</p>

<h3>Pre-Definition of Application Settings</h3>
<p>You may pre-define application settings in a multi-user environment by putting a configuration file <i>BalloonRss.exe.config</i> in the program directory. You need to manually edit this XML file. You start by obtaining the default settings file from the SVN repository at <a href="http://balloonrss.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/balloonrss/trunk/bin/BalloonRss.exe.config">http://balloonrss.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/balloonrss/trunk/bin/BalloonRss.exe.config</a> and modify it according your needs.</p>

<p>Once a user modifys its settings using the application configuration dialog, BalloonRss will create a user specific setting file in the user directory. This file then overrides the application settings.</p>
