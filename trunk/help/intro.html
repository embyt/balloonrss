<p>BalloonRSS is a simple RSS reader that displays incoming messages as balloon tooltips in the windows task bar. The news entries themselves are linked to be read with the browser.</p>

<p>The messages are retrieved from a set of configurable RSS feed sites. The news entry to view next is selected by a pre-defined priority which is dynamically adapted according the user's interest, which is determined by the user's message click rate.</p>
