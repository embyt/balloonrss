<h1>Usage</h1>

<p>As you start the application you get a notify icon in the windows task bar (at the right botton, near the clock). All commands are accessed by the context
menu (right click on the icon).</p>

<p>The first thing you might want to do is add your favourite RSS channels to be displayed. For this you need to select <i>RSS Channel Settings</i> and add them there. If you read multiple channels you may want to assign different priorities. Messages from higher priority RSS channels are more likely to be displayed. The effective priority is calculated by the pre-selected priority of the channel settings and the user's click rate. Thus, if you click more messages from one channel, this increases its effective priority and display probability.</p>

<p>A single left click on the application icon in the task bar enters pause mode. This is indicated with the color of the icon. No messages will be displayed in this status.</p>

<p>Color codes of the icon:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li><img src="images/blue16.png" width="16" height="16" alt="blue icon"> blue: application paused
<li><img src="images/yellow16.png" width="16" height="16" alt="yellow icon"> yellow: messages pending
<li><img src="images/orange16.png" width="16" height="16" alt="orange icon"> orange: no messages pending
</ul>
