<h2 id="sec_usage">Usage</h2>

<p>As you start the application you get a notify icon in the windows task bar (at the right button, near the clock). All commands are accessed by the context menu (right click on the icon). Make sure that the icon is always shown and not hidden by configuring this in windows.</p>

<p>The first thing you might want to do is add your favorite RSS channels to be displayed. For this you need to select <i>RSS Channel Settings</i> and add them there. If you read multiple channels you may want to assign different priorities. Messages from higher priority RSS channels are more likely to be displayed. The effective priority is calculated by the pre-selected priority of the channel settings and the user's click rate. Thus, if you click more messages from one channel, this increases its effective priority and display probability.</p>

<p>A single left click on the application icon in the task bar enters pause mode. This is indicated with the color of the icon. No messages will be displayed in this status. Double clicking the icon may also have functionality if this is configured in the <a href="applicationSettings.html">application settings</a>.</p>

<p>Color codes of the icon:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;"><img src="img/yellow16.png" width="16" height="16" alt="yellow icon" /> yellow: application active with messages pending</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none;"><img src="img/orange16.png" width="16" height="16" alt="orange icon" /> orange: application active without messages pending</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none;"><img src="img/blue16.png" width="16" height="16" alt="blue icon" /> blue: application paused</li>
</ul>
