<h2>Application Settings Dialog</h2>

<p>The application settings dialog allows the user to configure the behavior of the application. The settings have the following meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Time between displaying two RSS messages</b>: This value specifies the base time in minutes that elapses between two tooltip pop-ups with new RSS messages. The base time only applies between two messages as long as messages are available in the channel with the highest effective priority. As this channel has no more messages to display, the time span between 2 RSS messages will increase corresponding to the decrease in effective priority.</li>

<li><b>Interval for retrieving new RSS messages</b>: This value specifies the time in minutes between two retrievals of the RSS messages via the network. Thus, after each such interval, all RSS channels are retrieved.</li>

<li><b>Timespan to display balloon pop-up</b>: This value specifies the time interval in seconds, which a new RSS messages is displayed within the balloon tooltip. Consider that the Windows operating system controls the pop-up and may change the timing. I.e. the minimum time span is set to 10 seconds by the OS and the display interval will be extended if there is no user activity (e.g. using the mouse or keyboard).</li>

<li><b>Start in pause mode</b>: As this is described in the <a href="usage.html">usage section</a> BalloonRSS can be put into pause mode. If this checkbox is selected BalloonRSS will start in pause mode. You need to click the program item in the task bar to activate it then.</li>

<li><b>Use channel name as pop-up title</b>: Each displayed RSS message has two sections: the title and the content. Normally the title of the RSS message is displayed in the title section and its content is displayed below. If this checkbox is selected BalloonRSS will display the title of the RSS channel (instead of the RSS message) in the title field and the RSS message content below. BalloonRSS will not display the RSS message title then.</li>

<li><b>Number of entries in message history</b>: This value specifies the number of lines in the RSS message history dialog.</li>

<li><b>Priority influence of message clicks</b>: BalloonRSS calculates the effective priority of the RSS channels based on 2 inputs: the pre-defined priority of the channel and the number of user clicks onto RSS messages of this channel. This slider control enables the user to specify the influence of those 2 input characteristics. If the slider is put on the left side the influence of the pre-defined priority value is increased. If the slider is put to the right the click rate has higher influence. You can immediately check the results in the channel information dialog.</li>

<li><b>Check for application updates</b>: If this checkbox is selected BalloonRSS will check for potential updates on the SourceForge server. If a new version is available this will be reported as a message popup.</li>

<li><b>Report network errors</b>: If this checkbox is selected BalloonRSS will report any network error during retrieval of the RSS channels as a message popup. If the checkbox is not selected network errors will be ignored without notifying the user.</li>

<li><b>Double click action</b>: This drop-down list determines the action, which takes place as the application icon is double clicked.
<ul>
<li><i>Do nothing</i>: There is no action on double click.</li>
<li><i>Display next message</i>: The next RSS message is shown immediately. If no message is available nothing will happen. This equals to the action of the corresponding item in the main menu.</li>
<li><i>Open last message</i>: The details of the last shown RSS message will be opened within the web browser. If no message was shown yet nothing will happen. This equals to the action of the corresponding item in the main menu.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>All settings except enabling the application update are kept on a per-user basis. Therefore a change in the settings will only change the program behavior of the current user.</p>
